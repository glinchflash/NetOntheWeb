# NetOntheWeb


## Learning objectives
- Learn how to start a webApp project.
- Explore the generated folder structure.
- Adding extra pages.
- Adding a Model

## The Mission
Create a .NET webApp and (try to) understand everything that is generated for you.
We will also try to add some extra pages and a Model.


## TODO: YOUR TASKS
You got the basics of creating pages, models AND making them work together!

Now you have to figure a few things out:

     - Instead of one Student I want multiple students, show them in an nice list
     - I don't want to fill in the URL make sure your nav is up to date
     - I would love to see some teachers and class rooms make these Models, Views and show them.
     - NICE TO HAVE -> Make a relation between these Models

### Must haves progress
- :heavy_check_mark: Instead of one Student I want multiple students, show them in an nice list
- :heavy_check_mark: I don't want to fill in the URL make sure your nav is up to date
- :heavy_check_mark: I would love to see some teachers and class rooms make these Models, Views and show them.


### Nice to have 
- [ ] Make a relation between these Models (Will have to come back for this one, can't seem to figure it out, might be going about it the wrong way so decided to move forward and return when more expierence/knowledge has been gained)
